<h1>Security Information & Events Manager (SIEM)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I am setting up an Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system within a home lab environment. This project will involve deploying and configuring the Elastic Stack, a powerful suite of open-source tools for monitoring, logging, and data visualization. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with Elastic Stackâ€™s capabilities, particularly in the context of cybersecurity operations, by setting up a functional SIEM system that can collect, analyze, and visualize log data from various sources.
